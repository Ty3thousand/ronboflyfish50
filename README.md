This is a website that I am creating for Ron Martinez. The focus is to outline and document his trip accross all 50 states.

In each state he will be fly fishing with the goal of catching a fish at each stops with this website you will be able to view each state with either the map or the dropdown menu.

To start on local host:

npm Install
npm run dev

I am hosting this on vercel with github as my go between
